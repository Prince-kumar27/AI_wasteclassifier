# Waste Classifier Using Tkinter and CVZone

This project is a **Waste Classification System** that leverages machine learning and computer vision to classify waste into different categories (e.g., glass, plastic, paper) and provides recommendations for appropriate recycling bins. The user interacts with the system through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Tkinter**, while the waste classification is powered by a trained **TensorFlow/Keras** model integrated with **CVZone**.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for waste classification and recycling guidance.
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses a trained deep learning model to classify waste.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the waste category and highlights the corresponding bin with overlaid images.
- **File Selection**: Allows users to browse and select waste images for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

## How It Works
- **Load Waste Image:** Browse and select a waste image through the GUI.
- **AI Model Prediction:** The selected image is processed by the AI model to classify the waste type.
### **Visualize Output:**
- Displays the selected waste type image.
- Shows the recommended bin overlayed on a background image.


## Future Enhancements:
- **Expand Dataset:** Train the model with a larger and more diverse dataset for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Classification:** Integrate webcam support for real-time waste classification.
- **Mobile Version:** Build a mobile application for on-the-go waste classification.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Add localization for a global audience.
